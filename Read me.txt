I have used chrome selenium web driver,ruby gems 2.6.6  for testing

Form.rb

script will perform automated testing 

Form_test.rb

postive test case: form is submitted
The form is submitted because required fields are filled with proper values.'Name and 'Check box have proper values so it is submitted even though other values are not filled.This shows success test case

Form_test1.rb

 negative test case: form is not submitted
The form cannot be submitted because the value of 'Name' field is empty.As 'Name is required it cannot be submitted without proper value eventhough check box is selected.This shows failed test test case.
